# Calculator

A difficult project for sure!

Skills learnt/practiced:

- Combining CSS Grid and Flex
- Toggleable layouts
- Use button border-radius to change click-area shape
- CSS display:none cannot interact with transition properties (working methods may well be taught at a later point in the course - if so, I may come back and update the toggle to show and animated layout switch)
- String/array methods e.g. .slice(), .includes(), .some() etc.
- Using parseInt()/parseFloat()
- Why eval() is potentially dangerous
- HTML entities and Unicode values
- Recursion can be much slower than iteration (recursive factorial function was far slower than the iterative method, e.g. processing 40320! with iteration instantly shows "huge number" due to JS limitations but recursively will freeze due to an incredibly long call stack)
